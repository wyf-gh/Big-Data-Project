1. Interest Rate Trend Insights
-------------------------------
- US: Implemented aggressive rate hikes from 2022 (0.25% → 5.50%), maintaining high rates in 2024 to combat inflation.
- Eurozone: Followed the US with rate hikes (from -0.50% to 4.00%), peaking in mid-2023.
- Japan: Ended the long-term negative rate policy in March 2024 (from -0.10% to 0.10%), the first rate hike in over a decade.
- China: Maintained relatively stable rates (around 1.50%-2.00%), with mild cuts to support economic growth.

2. Foreign Exchange Reserves Insights
-------------------------------------
- China: Reserves remained stable at over $3 trillion, the largest among the four economies, providing strong exchange rate support.
- Japan: Reserves declined slightly from $1.4 trillion to $1.2 trillion (2020-2024), partly due to yen intervention.
- US: Reserves stayed low (around $100 billion) – no need for high reserves as the USD is the global reserve currency.
- Eurozone: No direct reserves data available on FRED; recommend referring to ECB official reports.

3. Interest Rate Spread Insights
--------------------------------
- US-China Spread: Widened significantly in 2022 (peaked at ~4.00%), narrowing slightly in 2024 as US rate cut expectations rose.
- US-Japan Spread: Reached the largest gap (over 5.00%) in 2023, driving USD/JPY appreciation.
- US-Eurozone Spread: Remained around 1.00%-1.50% in 2024, with limited impact on EUR/USD volatility.

4. Key Recommendations
----------------------
- For汇率 (Exchange Rate) Analysis: Focus on US-China and US-Japan spreads – historical data shows a strong positive correlation with USD/CNY and USD/JPY.
- For Policy Monitoring: Track Fed and ECB rate cut timelines (2024-2025) – likely to impact global capital flows.
- For Data Completeness: Supplement Eurozone reserves data from ECB官网 (www.ecb.europa.eu) and China's LPR data from PBC官网.
